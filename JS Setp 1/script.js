// -word vs keyword 
// baba, yaya or any text that has no meaning in JavaScript is word, these text are not reserved by JS
// for, var, let or any text that has meaning in JavaScript is keyword, they are reserved by JavaScript


// -var const let

// variable and constent 
// score = 3, life = 2

// code ma data store garna use hune lai variable vaninxa

var a = 12
var b = 19
// a = 6

const changeNahune = 'assign gareko data change hudaina'
const c = 4
// c = 6

let d = 'variables nai ho but differnt from var , check on double minus the difference'


// -hoisting
// not hosting  !! don't be confuse

// variable and function are hoisted wihch mean there declaration is moved on top of code

console.log(e)
var e; //declaration
e =12 //initialization or to set 

//hoisting makes var e at top of all, that's why even if we declare var e below console, it execute var e
